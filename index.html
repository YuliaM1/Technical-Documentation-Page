            <article>
               <p>
                  HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your
                  content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use
                  to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it
                  appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags
                  can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can
                  italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so
                  on. For example, take the following line of content:
               </p>
               <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
               <p>
                  If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify
                  that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
               </p>
               <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;&sol;p&gt;</code>
            </article>
         </section>
         <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
            <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
            <article>
               <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
               <img
                  src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png"
               />
               <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element
                     (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle
                     brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to
                     take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag,
                     except that it includes a forward slash before the element
                     name. This states where the element ends — in this case
                     where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is
                     one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange
                     results.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     The content: This is the content of the element, which in
                     this case, is just text.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the
                     content together comprise the element.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                  Elements can also have attributes that look like the
                  following:
               </p>
               <img
                  src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png"
               />
               <p>
                  Attributes contain extra information about the element that
                  you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here,
                  <span class="inline-code">class</span> is the attribute name
                  and <span class="inline-code">editor-note</span> is the
                  attribute value. The
                  <span class="inline-code">class</span> attribute allows you to
                  give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to
                  target it (and any other elements with the same
                  <span class="inline-code">class</span> value) with style
                  information and other things.
               </p>
               <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     A space between it and the element name (or the previous
                     attribute, if the element already has one or more
                     attributes).
                  </li>
                  <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                  <li>
                     The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing
                     quotation marks.
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </article>
         </section>
         <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
            <header>Nesting elements</header>
            <article>
               <p>
                  You can put elements inside other elements too — this is
                  called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very
                  grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a &lt;strong&gt;
                  element, which means that the word is to be strongly
                  emphasized:
               </p>
               <code>
                  <pre>
&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;&sol;strong&gt; grumpy&lt;&sol;p&gt;</pre
                  >
               </code>
               <p>
                  You do however need to make sure that your elements are
                  properly nested. In the example above, we opened the
                  <span class="inline-code">&lt;p&gt;</span> element first, then
                  the <span class="inline-code">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element;
                  therefore, we have to close the
                  <span class="inline-code">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element first,
                  then the <span class="inline-code">&lt;p&gt;</span> element.
                  The following is incorrect:
               </p>
               <code>
                  <pre>
&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy&lt;&sol;p&gt;&lt;&sol;strong&gt;</pre
                  >
               </code>
               <p>
                  The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are
                  clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap as
                  shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best
                  guess at what you were trying to say, which can lead to
                  unexpected results. So don't do it!
               </p>
            </article>
         </section>
         <section class="main-section" id="Empty_elements">
            <header>Empty elements</header>
            <article>
               <p>
                  Some elements have no content and are called empty elements.
                  Take the <span class="inline-code">&lt;img&gt;</span> element
                  that we already have in our HTML page:
               </p>
               <code>
                  <pre>
&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</pre
                  >
               </code>
               <p>
                  This contains two attributes, but there is no closing
                  <span class="inline-code">&lt;&sol;img&gt;</span> tag and no
                  inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap
                  content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the
                  HTML page in the place it appears.

                  That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they
                  aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual
                  elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's
                  revisit the code we put into our
                  <span class="inline-code">index.html</span> example:
               </p>
               <code>
                  <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en-US"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;&sol;title&gt;
  &lt;&sol;head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;
  &lt;&sol;body&gt;
&lt;&sol;html&gt;</pre
                  >
               </code>
               <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <span class="inline-code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> —
                     doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time,
                     when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant
                     to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to
                     follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean
                     automatic error checking and other useful things. However
                     these days, they don't do much and are basically just
                     needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's
                     all you need to know for now.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <span class="inline-code"
                        >&lt;html&gt;&lt;&sol;html&gt;</span
                     >
                     — the
                     <span class="inline-code">&lt;html&gt;</span> element. This
                     element wraps all the content on the entire page and is
                     sometimes known as the root element.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <span class="inline-code"
                        >&lt;head&gt;&lt;&sol;head&gt;</span
                     >
                     — the
                     <span class="inline-code">&lt;head&gt;</span> element. This
                     element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to
                     include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are
                     showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like
                     keywords and a page description that you want to appear in
                     search results, CSS to style our content, character set
                     declarations, and more.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <span class="inline-code"
                        >&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</span
                     >
                     — This element sets the character set your document should
                     use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast
                     majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now
                     handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no
                     reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems
                     later on.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <span class="inline-code"
                        >&lt;title&gt;&lt;&sol;title&gt;</span
                     >
                     — the
                     <span class="inline-code">&lt;title&gt;</span> element.
                     This sets the title of your page, which is the title that
                     appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is
                     also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite
                     it.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                     >
                     — the
                     <span class="inline-code">&lt;body&gt;</span> element. This
                     contains all the content that you want to show to web users
                     when they visit your page, whether that's text, images,
                     videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
